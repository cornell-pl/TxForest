# Seperating the Forest and ZFS Repos
## previously done

- seperate the code and get them compiling on own with out eachother
  - mostly just dun files and things
- implement simple in memory fs for forest to run on
  - using hashmap like in utils
  - note: this has a bug with the paths that has yet to be fixed
- implement posix version of fs for forest to run on
  - uses Core.Unix and Core.Sys modules to interact with the file system
  - probably needs some extra things so that it can run on both mac and window
- re-organize types so they match the paper more closely and put some in
utils file so they can be shared between modules better
- implement in memory "copy" of posix file system for forest to run on before commiting a transaction (to be changed still)
- add Filesystems module, since forest needs a module for its temporary and
persisitant file systems
- add logging to above file system
- add logging to the forest repo to support transactionality
- add transaction checking logic for commiting / uncommiting in the forest repo
- add final commit logic for updating the global fs for forest
- updated ppx to work with the above scheme
- make the local logs mutable to make merging logs easier, and evaluating expressions cleaner
- switch ppx back and update it to work with this version
- implemented server and a version of ForestIntf using this server
- started on the client
- tho disclaimer, im not sure about how correct this is, I didnt get a chance to test it yet, its prolly pretty buggy
  - the scheme i am using is haveing the client send their specification to the server, im not sure if this is the best way to go, but it seems like since the restrictions are enforced on the server side we want the spec to be there, but since we want the server to work with multiple specs we want the client to send to the server the spec

- look more into out options for ppx, it looks like the best approach will be to reimplement forest in python to avoid the python users having to do a complicated install to use our library, expose a bunch of objects for the user to work with and then overload some operators to make working with the objects nicer
  - theres anonther doc with all the stuff from this

- debuging the server and client
  - had some fun with marshaling not typing things
  - had an issue with the specs, because we have functions in the spec they
  can not be sent through the marshalling well
    - it is possible to send functions, but because the server and client are different pieces of code it messes with the way they serialize and deserialize functions.
    - thus sending the spec in its ocaml form is not really an option
    - I was playing with sending the raw string version of the spec to the servere and then parsing it at run time, but I was having trouble with
    using ppx at running time, it doesnt really seem like it can be used in this way
    - I settled on setting up a module that will contain all the specs, and has a mapping from identifier of spec to the spec.
    - client sends identifier and then server gets spec from the mapping
    - this isnt ideal, but seems like the most extensible way to do this.
  - I debuged all the traversal commands, fetch, and commit (only with a single client tho) and they seem to be behaving properly
  - there was a bug in the FS I had to fix, I was just not intializing the path correctly in the server

- python spec
  - drafted version I showed in the meeting
  - made updates to use higher order embeding
  - thoughts

## Last week
- push the forest ocaml stuff client side, so the spec an be there, the fs can be there etc.
  - this is so much cleaner, wow

- made the client more user friendly
  - only one down, one up command
  - skips over the `"dir'"` pairs
  - can ls for dependent pairs

- documented more in the readmes what stuff is where

- python work through the directory add version
  - I wrote this example out and thought about it seems to work
  - went with the add command and then realized can over ride the dictionary assignment to make this even nicer
  - override the dictionary get/set command to make writing this out nice
  - wrote out a prototype version of the spec hierarcy
  - realized can pass in a dict to Directory and can recursivly access the spec its assigned to, allowing to initialize all at once instead of the add thing

- draft for the project plan for the python implementation

- python stubs of the hierarcy of things, with stubs for impementation

- write another the uncommited version, using the temp files idea
  - this is in progress, most of the logic is there I just need to implment the
  merging of the two filesystems (I think I will need to keep track of things that I have not read the children of yet, to do this which means this will be nontrivial to do)
  - the idea of how i did it, is copying the files from the real version to the temp version as you read them (walk through the spec)
  - and writing to the temp version
  - decided to copy the read to avoid the situation where the user does something like exists and gets back a file is there, another transaction commits removing the file, then this transaction trys to read the file and
  its not there anymore.
  - ie copy the reads to keep the view of the underliying file system consistant

## This week
- wrote the local forest syntax in a python version
  - navigation
  - storage
  - fetching
  - some nice navigation stuff

-tested with the simple example


## Whats next

- finish temp fs stuff
- testing more

- python implementation
  - implement the core forest transaction logic
  - implement the in mem FS
  - maybe implement the global semantics


## Long term next
- document in code more
- test more
- port over all examples to this updated version of ocaml

- python version
